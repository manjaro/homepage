Manjaro comes in many different edition, all with an unique workflow and user experience from a traditional desktop-environments to window-managers that are optimized for maximum performance and work efficience.

The system is set up easily, while giving developers all the freedom and space to tinker when wanted. All tools to compile and develop software are pre-installed. The integrated package-manager allows easy installation of IDE like [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/ide/), [KDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org/) or [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) and libraries like [libnoise](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/), [boost](http://www.boost.org/) or [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).

Dependencies are automatically resolved and installing a library automatically install all needed headers to directly use it. Each edition comes preinstalled with powerful editors like [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) or [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), while more editors like [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) or [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/) are installed with one command or a few clicks.

Additional to the repositories, Manjaro supports the Arch User Repository (AUR) that includes cutting-edge software and libraries, proprietary software like [Unity Editor](https://unity3d.com/unity/editor) or [yEd](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).

Manjaro is a rolling-release distribution, which means that software is updated as soon as possible. This prevents lack of needed dependencies and old and buggy tool versions.
