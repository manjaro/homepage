features: Manjaro come preinstalled with [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), which is a very powerful image manipulation program. For drawing [Krita](https://krita.org/) will fulfill most of your needs, while [Darktable](http://www.darktable.org/) brings a top-notch and free photography suite. For simple or advanced video-editing, [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) and [OpenShot](http://www.openshot.org/) will do almost anything you need. There are also professional video-editing tools like [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/). 3D-Modelling can be done using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Most of this software is completely free available and can be easily and secure installed by using Manjaro's integrated package manager.

quote: Manjaro provides the tools to handle difficult tasks like kernel, video driver upgrades, downgrades. [...]  I soon realised I can do all my editing on linux with Darktable for raw files and some retouching or other editing with Gimp.
